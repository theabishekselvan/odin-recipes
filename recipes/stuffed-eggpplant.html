    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This delicious stuffed eggplant with a <em>cheesy</em> top is a must-try recipe! Great as a hearty main but you can buy the mini eggplants and use them for a side dish or appetizer.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eggplant:</strong> Youâ€™ll need one eggplant (halved lengthwise) to make two servings. </li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong>Brush the shells with olive oil before seasoning with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong>This stuffed eggplant is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh garlic, and fresh basil. </li>
        <li><strong>Sausage:</strong>Sweet Italian sausage makes this stuffed eggplant a hearty, crowd-pleasing meal. </li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong>An onion and fresh mushrooms lend texture and flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Pasta sauce:</strong>Use store-bought or <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/214898/homemade-tomato-basil-pasta-sauce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tomato-basil pasta sauce. </a> </li>
        <li><strong>Bread crumbs:</strong>Italian-seasoned panko bread crumbs give the stuffed eggplant a welcome crunch. </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmesan cheese instead of using the pre-shredded stuff. </li>
    </ul>
